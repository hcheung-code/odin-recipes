    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mushroom risotto is a creamy, savory Italian dish made with Arborio rice, cooked slowly in broth, and enriched with sautéed mushrooms, garlic, and Parmesan cheese.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Arborio rice</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 pound of mushrooms (such as cremini, button, or a mix), sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley (for garnish, optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Broth:</strong> In a small saucepan, bring the chicken or vegetable broth to a simmer. Keep it warm on low heat.</li>
        <li><strong>the Mushrooms:</strong> Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and sauté until softened and browned, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Onions and Garlic:</strong> In the same pan, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another 1 minute, being careful not to burn it.</li>
        <li><strong>Toast the Rice:</strong> Add the Arborio rice to the pan with the onions and garlic. Stir for 1-2 minutes until the rice is lightly toasted.</li>
        <li><strong>Deglaze with Wine:</strong> If using, pour in the white wine and stir until absorbed by the rice.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Broth:</strong> Begin adding the warm broth, one ladle at a time, to the rice. Stir constantly until most of the liquid is absorbed before adding the next ladle of broth. Continue this process for 18-20 minutes, or until the rice is creamy and cooked al dente.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish the Risotto:</strong> Once the rice is cooked, stir in the sautéed mushrooms and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Spoon the risotto into bowls, garnish with fresh parsley (optional), and serve immediately.</li>
