    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish from Rome, known for its rich and creamy sauce made without cream. It consists of spaghetti (or another pasta), crispy guanciale (cured pork cheek), egg yolks, Pecorino Romano cheese, and freshly ground black pepper. The heat from the pasta gently cooks the egg mixture, creating a smooth, velvety sauce that clings to the noodles. Traditionally, no additional cream or butter is used, as the emulsification of eggs, cheese, and pasta water achieves the perfect texture. Simple yet indulgent, carbonara is a beloved dish that highlights the beauty of a few high-quality ingredients.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil: This traditional Italian recipe starts with olive oil. </li>
        <li>Guanciale: Buy guanciale (or cured pork cheek) at your local butcher. If you can&#39;t find it, you can substitute unsmoked bacon or pancetta.</li>
        <li>Spaghetti: Use store-bought or homemade spaghetti noodles. If you like, you can substitute bucatini for the spaghetti. </li>
        <li>Eggs: Three large eggs add richness and flavor. </li>
        <li>Cheese: Opt for hand-shredded Pecorino Romano cheese. You can substitute Parmesan, if preferred.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: This flavorful spaghetti alla carbonara is simply seasoned with salt and pepper. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pork in olive oil until browned and crispy, then drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Boil the spaghetti in salted water. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs, 1/2 of the cheese, and some pepper in a bowl until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg mixture over the pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy.</li>
        <li>Stir in the pork, then top with the remaining cheese and more black pepper.</li>
</ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
